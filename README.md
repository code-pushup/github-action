For example, this will run `code-pushup` commands in a non-root folder and
retain report artifacts for 30 days:

```yml
- uses: code-pushup/github-action@v0
  with:
    directory: website
    retention: 30
```

## Action outputs

Some outputs are set in case you want to add further steps to your workflow.

| Name          | Description                      |
| :------------ | :------------------------------- |
| `artifact-id` | ID of uploaded report artifact   |
| `comment-id`  | ID of created/updated PR comment |

Example of using step outputs:

```yml
- uses: code-pushup/github-action@v0
  id: code-pushup
- run: |
    echo "Comment ID is ${{ steps.code-pushup.outputs.comment-id }}"
    echo "Artifact ID is ${{ steps.code-pushup.outputs.artifact-id }}"
```
